    This file will always be in the JCR6 map as Script/System/EmptyMap.lua
    This file is always tied to it from LAURA II internally.
    Don't even try to patch it out, you either won't succeed, unless you
    rebuild LAURA II completely, and doing that can really cause great
    damage if you don't know what you are doing.
