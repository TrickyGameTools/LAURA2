Note about the GNU license.
The GNU license is normally a "viral" license. However, the "viral" part of this license does NOT affect the games created with LAURA II.
All scripts and assets the games will use, and essentially the game itself as well, are considered "the data", and thus not as the "code".
This being said it *is* possible to create games with LAURA II not using the GNU license without violating the "viral" terms of the license.
