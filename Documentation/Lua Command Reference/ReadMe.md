# Lua command reference
If you are considering to write a game yourself in LAURA II, well where should I begin...?
Well, let's say that some more documentation is on the way if you want to go down that road, or that you can ask me how to set things up.
The easiest way to set up a LAURA II project yourself is by 'cannibalizing' an existing project. At least that sets the base right.

At least I can give you this command reference. If you have been wondering what all those "BLD:" comments were doing in my BlitzMax source, well here's your answer.

"BLD" is the abbreviation for "Build Lua Documentation". It's a tool that generates an HTML file from all the Lua references found in the BlitzMax source. I actually use this reference myself a lot as I created so much functionality to Lua by means of LAURA II itself and by the GALE project, that it's hard for me to keep track of it all.

This is just a very quick reference of all commands LAURA II adds to Lua. Just download all files in this folder and open it with any webbrowser and there you go. :)

Have fun
